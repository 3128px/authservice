# authservice [![Actions Status](https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/authservice/workflows/Master%20Commit/badge.svg)](https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/authservice/actions)
An implementation of [Envoy](https://envoyproxy.io) [External Authorization](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/ext_authz_filter),
focused on delivering authN/Z solutions for [Istio](https://istio.io) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

## Introduction
`authservice` helps delegate the [OIDC Authorization Code Grant Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth)
to the Istio mesh. `authservice` is compatible with any standard OIDC Provider as well as other Istio End-user Auth features,
including [Authentication Policy](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/security/authn-policy/) and [RBAC](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/security/rbac-groups/).
Together, they allow developers to protect their APIs and web apps without any application code required.

## Using the `authservice` docker image
The `authservice` images are hosted on [authservice's GitHub Package Registry](https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/authservice/packages).
NOTE: Github Package Registry currently does **NOT** work with Kubernetes. [This issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/870) 
is expected to be fixed and released soon. For the time being, you need to manually `docker pull` the image from Github Package Registry
and `docker push` it to your own image registry (e.g. Docker Hub) in order to use it with Kubernetes.

## Example
Please refer to the [bookinfo-example](./bookinfo-example) directory for an example integration. 

## Developer Notes
See the [Makefile](Makefile) for common tasks.

## Roadmap
See the [authservice github Project](https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/authservice/projects/1)

Features not yet implemented:
 - Token renewal via refresh token.
 - Start new flow to fetch new tokens when either the ID token or the access token has expired.
 - Support multiple IDPs for the same app.
 - Support adding ext_authz filter and using the `authservice` on the Istio ingress gateway.

Additional features being considered:
 - A more Istio-integrated experience of deploying/configuring/enabling `authservice` 
 (e.g.: extending Istio Authentication Policy to include `authservice` configs).
